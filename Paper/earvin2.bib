	Abstract = {A common element in modelling forest fires and earthquakes is the need to develop space-time point process models that can be used to quantify the evolving risk from forest fires (or earthquakes) as a function of time, location, and background factors. This paper is intended as an introduction to space-time point process modelling. It includes brief summaries of the most relevant point process properties, starting from the description and estimation of first and second order moment properties, proceeding to a description of conditional intensity or dynamic models, and ending with an introduction to some of the models and estimation procedures which are currently being used in seismology. A short final section contrasts the modelling problems for seismology and for forest fires.},

@article{Meyer11,
	Abstract = {Summary A novel point process model continuous in space--time is proposed for quantifying the transmission dynamics of the two most common meningococcal antigenic sequence types observed in Germany 2002--2008. Modeling is based on the conditional intensity function (CIF), which is described by a superposition of additive and multiplicative components. As an epidemiological interesting finding, spread behavior was shown to depend on type in addition to age: basic reproduction numbers were 0.25 (95% CI 0.19--0.34) and 0.11 (95% CI 0.07--0.17) for types B:P1.7--2,4:F1--5 and C:P1.5,2:F3--3, respectively. Altogether, the proposed methodology represents a comprehensive and universal regression framework for the modeling, simulation, and inference of self-exciting spatiotemporal point processes based on the CIF. Usability of the modeling in biometric practice is promoted by an implementation in the R package surveillance.},

	Abstract = {Questions:  Do spatial and temporal patterns of encroachment of Pinus contorta and Abies grandis in a montane meadow suggest strong biotic controls on the invasion process?Location:  Forest--meadow mosaic, 1350 m a.s.l., Cascade Range, Oregon, US.Methods:  We combined spatial point pattern analysis, population age structures, and a time-series of stem maps to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of conifer invasion over a 200-yr period in three plots totaling 4 ha.Results:  Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s). Recent invasion was not correlated with climatic variation. Abies grandis dominated both periods; P. contorta established at lower density, peaking before A. grandis. Spatially, older (â‰¥90 yr) P. contorta were randomly distributed, but older A. grandis were strongly clumped (0.2-20 m). Younger (<90 yr) stems were positively associated at small distances (both within and between species), but were spatially displaced from older A. grandis, suggesting a temporal shift from facilitation to competition. Establishment during the 1800s resulted in widely scattered P. contorta and clumps of A. grandis that placed most areas of meadow close to seed sources permitting more rapid invasion during the mid-1900s. Rapid conversion to forest occurred via colonization of larger meadow openings -- first by shade-intolerant P. contorta, then by shade-tolerant A. grandis-- and by direct infilling of smaller openings by A. grandis.Conclusions:  In combination, spatial and temporal patterns of establishment suggest an invasion process shaped by biotic interactions, with facilitation promoting expansion of trees into meadows and competition influencing subsequent forest development. Once invasion is initiated, tree species with different life histories and functional traits can interact synergistically to promote rapid conversion of meadow to forest under a broad range of climatic conditions.},

@article{Hooten08,
	Abstract = {The spread of invasive species is a long studied subject that garners much interest in the ecological research community. Historically the phenomenon has been approached using a purely deterministic mathematical framework (usually involving differential equations of some form). These methods, while scientifically meaningful, are generally highly simplified and fail to account for uncertainty in the data and process, of which our knowledge could not possibly exist without error. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for population spread that accommodates data sources with errors, dependence structures between population dynamics parameters, and takes into account prior scientific understanding via non-linear relationships between model parameters and space-time response variables. We model the process (i.e., the bird population in this case) as a Poisson response with spatially varying diffusion coefficients as well as a logistic population growth term using a common reaction-diffusion equation that realistically mimics the ecological process. We focus the application on the ongoing invasion of the Eurasian Collared-Dove.},

@article{Gatrell96,
	Abstract = {This paper reviews a number of methods for the exploration and modelling of spatial point patterns with particular reference to geographical epidemiology (the geographical incidence of disease). Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses which have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed.},

@article{Rice12,
	Abstract = {Tree invasions of grasslands are occurring globally, with profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. We explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of tree invasion of a montane meadow in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, where meadow loss is a conservation concern. We examine the early stages of invasion, where extrinsic and intrinsic processes can be clearly delineated. In a 0.21-ha plot, we mapped and aged 929 trees â‰¥0.3-m tall, yielding a detailed record of the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion. For the primary species, Abies grandis and Pinus contorta , we correlated age structures (unimodal in both species) with climate (precipitation, temperature, and snowpack) and cone production, but found weak or non-significant relationships. Evidence of biotic interactions within and between species was obtained by examining the spatial associations of trees to a distance of 5 m and how these changed over time. We used multiple methods including uni- and bivariate forms of the Ripley's K and pair-correlation function (pcf) (corrected for inhomogeneity), the J-function, an evolving nearest-neighbor metric, and a test for directional bias in establishment. Pinus and Abies contributed in contrasting ways to the pace and spatial structure of invasion. Shade-intolerant Pinus tended to establish in the open, initiating clusters. In contrast, shade-tolerant Abies established in association with Pinus or in conspecific clusters. Preferential establishment of Abies to the north of older Pinus suggests that facilitation occurs by shading. The factors responsible for initial establishment remain unresolved, but positive interactions are pivotal in accelerating invasions, once initiated. Similar processes are likely to occur in other grasslands undergoing rapid conversion to woodland or forest. In combination, analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of establishment provide insight into the processes that structure invasions.},

@article{Wiegand04,
	Abstract = {A large number of methods for the analysis of point pattern data have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields. First-order statistics describe large-scale variation in the intensity of points in a study region, whereas second-order characteristics are summary statistics of all point-to-point distances in a mapped area and offer the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns. Second-order analysis based on Ripley's K-function is increasingly used in ecology to characterize spatial patterns and to develop hypothesis on underlying processes; however, the full range of available methods has seldomly been applied by ecologists. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in second-order analysis to help in the choice of appropriate methods and to point to practical difficulties and pitfalls. We review (1) methods for analytical and numerical implementation of two complementary second-order statistics, Ripley's K and the O-ring statistic, (2) methods for edge correction, (3) methods to account for first-order effects (i.e. heterogeneity) of univariate patterns, and (4) a variety of useful standard and non-standard null models for univariate and bivariate patterns. For illustrative purpose, we analyze examples that deal with non-homogeneous univariate point patterns. We demonstrate that large-scale heterogeneity of a point-pattern biases Ripley's K-function at smaller scales. This bias is difficult to detect without explicitly testing for homogeneity, but we show that it can be removed when applying methods that account for first-order effects. We synthesize our review in a number of step-by-step recommendations that guide the reader through the selection of appropriate methods and we provide a software program that implements most of the methods reviewed and developed here.},

	Abstract = {Forestry statistics is an important field of applied statistics with a long tradition. Many forestry problems can be solved by means of point processes or marked point processes. There, the ``points ''are tree locations and the ``marks '' are tree characteristics such as diameter at breast height or degree of damage by environmental factors. Point process characteristics are valuable tools for exploratory data analysis in forestry, for describing the variability of forest stands and for understanding and quantifying ecological relationships. Models of point processes are also an important basis of modern single-tree modeling, that gives simulation tools for the investigation of forest structures and for the prediction of results of forestry operations such as plantation and thinning.},

@article{Marco11,
	Abstract = {Dispersal is a factor of great importance in determining a species spatial distribution. Short distance dispersal (SDD) and long distance dispersal (LDD) strategies yield very different spatial distributions. In this paper we compare spatial spread patterns from SDD and LDD simulations, contrast them with patterns from field data, and assess the significance of biological and population traits.Simulated SDD spread using an exponential function generates a single circular patch with a well-defined invasion front showing a travelling-wave structure. The invasive spread is relatively slow as it is restricted to reproductive individuals occupying the outer zone of the circular patch. As a consequence of this dispersal dynamics, spread is slower than spread generated by LDD. In contrast, the early and fast invasion of the entire habitat mediated by power law LDD not only involves a significantly greater invasion velocity, but also an entirely different habitat occupation. As newly dispersed individuals soon reach very distant portions of the habitat as well as the vicinity of the original dispersal focus, new growing patches are generated while the main patch increases its own growth absorbing the closest patches. As a consequence of both dispersal and lower density dependence, growth of the occupied area is much faster than with SDD.SDD and LDD also differ regarding pattern generation. With SDD, fractal patterns appear only in the border of the invasion front in SDD when competitive interaction with residents is included. In contrast, LDD patterns show fractality both in the spatial arrangements of patches as well as in patch borders. Moreover, values of border fractal dimension inform on the dispersal process in relation with habitat heterogeneity. The distribution of patch size is also scale-free, showing two power laws characteristic of small and large patch sizes directly arising from the dispersal and reproductive dynamics.Ecological factors like habitat heterogeneity are relevant for dispersal, although its importance is greater for SDD, lowering the invasion velocity. Among the life history traits considered, adult mortality, the juvenile bank and mean dispersal distance are the most relevant for SDD. For LDD, habitat heterogeneity and changes in life history traits are not so relevant, causing minor changes in the values of the scale-free parameters.Our work on short and long distance dispersal shows novel theoretical differences between SDD and LDD in invasive systems (mechanisms of pattern formation, fractal and scaling properties, relevance of different life history traits and habitat variables) that correspond closely with field examples and were not analyzed, at least in this degree of detail, by the previously existing models.},

	Abstract = {1. This article reviews the application of some summary statistics from current theory of spatial point processes for extracting information from spatial patterns of plants. Theoretical measures and issues connected with their estimation are described. Results are illustrated in the context of specific ecological questions about spatial patterns of trees in two forests. 2. The pair correlation function, related to Ripley's K function, provides a formal measure of the density of neighbouring plants and makes precise the general notion of a 'plant's-eye' view of a community. The pair correlation function can also be used to describe spatial relationships of neighbouring plants with different qualitative properties, such as species identity and size class. 3. The mark correlation function can be used to describe the spatial relationships of quantitative measures (e.g. biomass). We discuss two types of correlation function for quantitative marks. Applying these functions to the distribution of biomass in a temperate forest, it is shown that the spatial pattern of biomass is uncoupled from the spatial pattern of plant locations. 4. The inhomogeneous pair correlation function enables first-order heterogeneity in the environment to be removed from second-order spatial statistics. We illustrate this for a tree species in a forest of high topographic heterogeneity and show that spatial aggregation remains after allowing for spatial variation in density. An alternative method, the master function, takes a weighted average of homogeneous pair correlation functions computed in subareas; when applied to the same data and compared with the former method, the spatial aggregations are smaller in size. 5. Synthesis. These spatial statistics, especially those derived from pair densities, will help ecologists to extract important ecological information from intricate spatially correlated plants in populations and communities.},

	Abstract = {Aimâ€‚ We present an integrated approach for predicting future range expansion of an invasive species (Chinese tallow tree) that incorporates statistical forecasting and analytical techniques within a spatially explicit, agent-based, simulation framework.Locationâ€‚ East Texas and Louisiana, USA.Methodsâ€‚ We drew upon extensive field data from the US Forest Service and the US Geological Survey to calculate spread rate from 2003 to 2008 and to parameterize logistic regression models estimating habitat quality for Chinese tallow within individual habitat cells. We applied the regression analyses to represent population spread rate as a function of habitat quality, integrated this function into a logistic model representing local spread, and coupled this model with a dispersal model based on a lognormal kernel within the simulation framework. We simulated invasions beginning in 2003 based on several different dispersal velocities and compared the resulting spatial patterns to those observed in 2008 using cross Mantel's tests. We then used the best dispersal velocity to predict range expansion to the year 2023.Resultsâ€‚ Chinese tallow invasion is more likely in low and flat areas adjacent to water bodies and roads, and less likely in mature forest stands and in pine plantations where artificial regeneration by planting seedlings is used. Forecasted invasions resulted in a distribution that extended from the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana northward and westward as much as 300 km, representing approximately 1.58 million ha.Main conclusionsâ€‚ Our new approach of calculating time series projections of annual range expansion should assist land managers and restoration practitioners plan proactive management strategies and treatments. Also, as field sampling continues on the national array of FIA plots, these new data can be incorporated easily into the present model, as well as being used to develop and/or improve models of other invasive plant species.},

@article{Werner11,
	Abstract = {We present two models for estimating the probabilities of future earthquakes in California, to be tested in the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP). The first is a time-independent model of adaptively smoothed seismicity that we modified from Helmstetter et al. (2007). The model provides five-year forecasts for earthquakes with magnitudes Mâ‰¥4.95. We show that large earthquakes tend to occur near the locations of small Mâ‰¥2 events, so that a high-resolution estimate of the spatial distribution of future large quakes is obtained from the locations of the numerous small events. We further assume a universal Gutenberg--Richter magnitude distribution. In retrospective tests, we show that a Poisson distribution does not fit the observed rate variability, in contrast to assumptions in current earthquake predictability experiments. We therefore issued forecasts using a better-fitting negative binomial distribution for the number of events. The second model is a time-dependent epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model that we modified from Helmstetter et al. (2006) and that provides next-day forecasts for Mâ‰¥3.95. In this model, the forecasted rate is the sum of a background rate (proportional to the time-independent model rate) and of the expected rate of triggered events due to all prior earthquakes. Each earthquake triggers events with a rate that increases exponentially with its magnitude and decays in time according to the Omori--Utsu law. An isotropic kernel models the spatial density of aftershocks for small (Mâ‰¤5.5) events, while for larger quakes, we smooth early aftershocks to forecast later events. We estimate parameter values by optimizing retrospective forecasts and find that the short-term model realizes a probability gain of about 6.0 per earthquake over the time-independent model.},

	Abstract = {We constructed 5- and 10-yr smoothed-seismicity forecasts of moderate-to-large California earthquakes, and we examined the importance of several assumptions and choices. To do this, we divided the available catalog into learning and testing periods and optimized parameters to best predict earthquakes in the testing period. Fourteen different 5-yr testing periods were considered, in which the number of earthquakes varies from 18 to 63. We then compared the likelihood gain per target earthquake for the various choices. In this study, we assumed that the spatial, temporal, and magnitude distributions were independent of one another, so that the joint probability distribution could be factored into those three components. We compared several disjoint test periods of the same length to determine the variability of the likelihood gain. The variability is large enough to mask the effects of some modeling choices. Stochastic declustering of the learning catalog produced a significantly better forecast, and representing larger earthquakes by their rupture surfaces provided a slightly better result, all other choices being equal. Inclusion of historical earthquakes and the use of an anisotropic smoothing kernel based on focal mechanisms failed to improve the forecast consistently. We chose a lower threshold magnitude of 4.7 for our learning catalog so that our results could be compared in the future to other forecasts relying on shorter catalogs with a smaller magnitude threshold.},

@article{Tiampo12,
	Abstract = {Earthquake fault systems interact over a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales and, in recent years, studies of the regional seismicity in a variety of regions have produced a number of new techniques for seismicity-based earthquake forecasting. While a wide variety of physical assumptions and statistical approaches are incorporated into the various methodologies, they all endeavor to accurately replicate the statistics and properties of both the historic and instrumental seismic records. As a result, the last ten years have seen significant progress in the field of intermediate- and short-term seismicity-based earthquake forecasting. These include general agreement on the need for prospective testing and successful attempts to standardize both evaluation methods and the appropriate null hypotheses. Here we differentiate the predominant approaches into models based upon techniques for identifying particular physical processes and those that filter, or smooth, the seismicity. Comparison of the methods suggests that while smoothed seismicity models provide improved forecast capability over longer time periods, higher probability gain over shorter time periods is achieved with methods that integrate statistical techniques with our knowledge of the physical process, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model or those related to changes in the b-value, for example. In general, while both classes of seismicity-based forecasts are limited by the relatively short time period available for the instrumental catalog, significant advances have been made in our understanding of both the limitations and potential of seismicity-based earthquake forecasting. There is general agreement that both short-term forecasting, on the order of days to weeks, and longer-term forecasting over five-to-ten year periods, is within reach. This recent progress serves to illuminate both the critical nature of the different temporal scales intrinsic to the earthquake process and the importance of high quality seismic data for the accurate quantification of time-dependent earthquake hazard.},

@article{Helmstetter03,
	Abstract = {As part of an effort to develop a systematic methodology for earthquake forecasting, we use a simple model of seismicity on the basis of interacting events which may trigger a cascade of earthquakes, known as the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence model (ETAS). The ETAS model is constructed on a bare (unrenormalized) Omori law, the Gutenberg-Richter law, and the idea that large events trigger more numerous aftershocks. For simplicity, we do not use the information on the spatial location of earthquakes and work only in the time domain. We demonstrate the essential role played by the cascade of triggered seismicity in controlling the rate of aftershock decay as well as the overall level of seismicity in the presence of a constant external seismicity source. We offer an analytical approach to account for the yet unobserved triggered seismicity adapted to the problem of forecasting future seismic rates at varying horizons from the present. Tests presented on synthetic catalogs validate strongly the importance of taking into account all the cascades of still unobserved triggered events in order to predict correctly the future level of seismicity beyond a few minutes. We find a strong predictability if one accepts to predict only a small fraction of the large-magnitude targets. Specifically, we find a prediction gain (defined as the ratio of the fraction of predicted events over the fraction of time in alarms) equal to 21 for a fraction of alarm of 1{\%}, a target magnitude M \&{\#}8805; 6, an update time of 0.5 days between two predictions, and for realistic parameters of the ETAS model. However, the probability gains degrade fast when one attempts to predict a larger fraction of the targets. This is because a significant fraction of events remain uncorrelated from past seismicity. This delineates the fundamental limits underlying forecasting skills, stemming from an intrinsic stochastic component in these interacting triggered seismicity models. Quantitatively, the fundamental limits of predictability found here are only lower bounds of the true values corresponding to the full information on the spatial location of earthquakes.},

	Abstract = {A stochastic triggering (epidemic) model incorporating short-term clustering was fitted to the instrumental earthquake catalog of Italy for event with local magnitudes 2.6 and greater to optimize its ability to retrospectively forecast 33 target events of magnitude 5.0 and greater that occurred in the period 1990--2006. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of the information value of the model, forecasts of each event use parameter values obtained from data up to the end of the year preceding the target event. The results of the test are given in terms of the probability gain of the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model relative to a time-invariant Poisson model for each of the 33 target events. These probability gains range from 0.93 to 32000, with ten of the target events yielding a probability gain of at least 10. As the forecasting capability of the ETAS model is based on seismic activity recorded prior to the target earthquakes, the highest probability gains are associated with the occurrence of secondary mainshocks during seismic sequences. However, in nine of these cases, the largest mainshock of the sequence was marked by a probability gain larger than 50, having been preceded by previous smaller magnitude earthquakes. The overall evaluation of the performance of the epidemic model has been carried out by means of four popular statistical criteria: the relative operating characteristic diagram, the R score, the probability gain, and the log-likelihood ratio. These tests confirm the superior performance of the method with respect to a spatially varying, time-invariant Poisson model. Nevertheless, this method is characterized by a high false alarm rate, which would make its application in real circumstances problematic.},

	Abstract = {Branching point process models such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) models introduced by Ogata (1988, 1998) are often used in the description, characterization, simulation, and declustering of modern earthquake catalogs. The present work investigates how the parameters in these models vary across different tectonic zones. After considering divisions of the surface of the Earth into several zones based on the plate-boundary model of Bird (2003), ETAS models are fit to the occurrence times and locations of shallow earthquakes within each zone. Computationally, the expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithm of Veen and Schoenberg (2008) is employed for the purpose of model fitting. The fits and variations in parameter estimates for distinct zones are compared, and seismological implications are discussed. In particular, we find that estimated background seismicity rates range by a factor of nearly 500 for interplate and trench events, respectively; the estimated productivity parameter, governing the relationship between the magnitude of an earthquake and its expected number of direct aftershocks, ranges by a factor of more than five from events in the slow-moving zone to events in active continental areas, suggesting a much higher rate of swarming in the ridges than in the trenches and active continental zones. Despite the pronounced differences between the seismicity patterns and parameter estimates in the different zones, the ETAS model with few parameters and with the same functional form seems to fit reasonably well to the seismicity in each zone.},

	Abstract = {Earthquakes, whatever their size, can trigger other earthquakes. Mainshocks cause aftershocks to occur, which in turn activate their own local aftershock sequences, resulting in a cascade of triggering that extends the reach of the initial mainshock. A long-lasting difficulty is to determine which earthquakes are connected, either directly or indirectly. Here we show that this causal structure can be found probabilistically, with no a priori model nor parameterization. Large regional earthquakes are found to have a short direct influence in comparison to the overall aftershock sequence duration. Relative to these large mainshocks, small earthquakes collectively have a greater effect on triggering. Hence, cascade triggering is a key component in earthquake interactions.},

@article{Lonsdale93,
	Abstract = {1 The invasion of the wetlands of tropical Australia by the woody weed Mimosa pigra L. was examined at two scales: within a single wetland system on the Adelaide River flood plains, 70 km east of Darwin, and across the entire western coastal region of the Northern Territory. 2 Modelling indicated that, if wind dispersal alone were involved, the fastest rate of linear increase of a stand would be 18.3 m year$^{-1}$. Actual rates of spread in the wetland system were found from aerial photographs to average 76 m year$^{-1}$ or greater in five out of six years. This suggests that dispersal of seeds by flotation is central to the observed rapid expansion of the weed in the region's wetlands. 3 Skellam's (1951) model for areal spread was an inadequate descriptor of the spread of this invading species within the wetland system, probably because it assumes normally distributed dispersal distances, whereas actual distances were log-normally distributed, and because of the irregular, elongate shape of the infestation, where the model assumes roughly circular infestations. 4 There was a close correlation $(r = 0.94, P = 0.005)$ between the increase in the area colonized by the plant and the rainfall in the previous wet season, largely perhaps because of greater dispersal distances. The doubling time over the period of study averaged out at 1.2 years. 5 Across the region as a whole, the doubling time for numbers of infestations was much slower, being 6.7 years, probably because of the separation of the plant's major wetland habitats by eucalypt savannas that it can colonize less readily. There is no evidence to support the widespread popular perception that feral buffalo grazing suppressed the weed, nor that the removal of grazing pressure has resulted in an upsurge of the weed. 6 A graphical model is used to show that seed predators have little effect on the rate of spread of invasive plants until very high levels of predation are achieved, but that seed predators combined with folivores can slow the rate of spread considerably.},

@article{Perrins93,
	Abstract = {The rate and extent of spread of three introduced species of Impatiens (I. glandulifera Royle, I. parviflora DC and I. capensis meerburgh) in Britain was studied. The dates for the first records in each vice-county were obtained, and used to estimate rates of spread in England since their introduction. I. glandulifera was estimated as having a rate of spread of up to 38 km yr<sup>1</sup>, compared to a rate of up to 24 km yr<sup>1</sup> for I. parviflora. The use of vice-county data as opposed to 10 km squares is discussed. Comparative growth experiments were performed both in garden plots and in the field, in an attempt to identify characters which enabled I. glandulifera to be so successful. Frost tolerance and seed output seem to be important factors; there are no doubt others not identified. Occasional long distance dispersal events, probably aided by man, are considered to be responsible for the rapid spread of I. glandulifera. Impatiens glandulifera is a pest plant because it forms dense monospecific stands in damp woodland, swamping all other plants. It is able to do so because of early germination and rapid growth to a height higher than any other British annual. Local spread is limited to 2 m yr<sup>1</sup> from its own ballistic dispersal and to a small multiple of that from animal spread.},
